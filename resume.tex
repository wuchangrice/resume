Refactor the recall-service from Java cache to Apache Thrift. The recall-service which makes use of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering etc is part of recommender systems and it mainly supplies candidate data to recommender systems. Recommender systems can be divided into recall-service(data supporter), rank-service(ctr estimation) and rerank-service(strategy).
\begin{itemize}
  \item Server: Used TNonblockingServer to deal with client connections and service request. Used mmap to load data from disk to RAM. Designed special data structure to support inverted index and used protobuffer to support forward index.
  \item Client: Used BasePooledObjectFactory to manage connection pool. Calculated the periodical fail rate of each serverNode and dispatched requests to the serverNodes whose fail rate was within the threshold. Test the bad serverNode(whose fail rate was beyond the threshold) background and reset the fail rate when the bad serverNode became normal.
  \item Test: Used tcpdump and tcpcopy to test the recall-service before deployed to the product environment.
  \item Reduced recall-service's timeout(30ms) rate from 7.5‰ to 0.62‰.
\end{itemize}

Make recall service real-time
\begin{itemize}
  \item used Kafka, Thrift to push new data to Thrift Server.
  \item used shared-lock and uique-lock to manage real-time data.
  \item cut down the recall index's update-time from 40 min to real-time
\end{itemize}

Recall config management and service moinitor
\begin{itemize}
  \item Index configure management: used SpringBoot, MySQL, VUE to manage index configure.
  \item Monitor: used Graana and InfluxDB to monitor request's QPS, latency etc.
\end{itemize}

Refactor the insurance and loan modules from PHP CodeIgniter to Java SpringBoot.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Decoupled the insurance and loan modules from the main module and reduced the pressure of the key database.
  \item Used Kafka to get insurance clue from the dealed cars information and made the insurance fee and loan service fee can be paid through WeChat Pay.
\end{itemize}

Evaluate pre-owned car's price
\begin{itemize}
  \item Used empirical model based on city, car model, used years to calculate pre-owned car's price.
  \item Designed and implemented data crawling, data cleaning and data training.
  \item Build up a website by using PHP CodeIgniter framework to make the evaluation as a product.
  \item The accuracy(The difference between real price and the evaluated price within 10\%) was 75.5\% and the bad case(the difference beyond 20\%) was 6.2\%.The result was as the same accuracy as Che300(A professional company focused on pre-owned car's price evaluation).
\end{itemize}

\section{\faCogs\ Skills}
